- 👋 Hi, I’m @viskop
- 👀 I’m interested in all things IT-related, but would love to learn how to code. With the massive amounts of info on the web I'm lost and have no clue where to start. Oh, and I'm 70+.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning "ServiceNow" (only starting out on the fundamentals)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on "JavScript" coding.
- 📫 How to reach me: jamalcomputer@hotmail.com
